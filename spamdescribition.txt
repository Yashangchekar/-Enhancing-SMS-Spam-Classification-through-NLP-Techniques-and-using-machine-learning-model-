The project focuses on improving the efficiency of SMS spam classification using a combination of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and neural networks. The primary goal is to surpass the current accuracy achieved with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model by leveraging the capabilities of neural networks.

Key Components:

Text Preprocessing:
Extensive text preprocessing has been implemented to clean and prepare the SMS data for analysis. This includes tasks such as lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stop words, stemming, and handling special characters or numbers.

Feature Engineering:
The project employs feature engineering to extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data. This step is crucial for improving the model's ability to discern between spam and non-spam messages effectively.

SVM Model (Baseline):
The baseline model utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for SMS spam classification. This model has shown high accuracy, reaching 98%. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of more advanced models.

Neural Network Architecture:
To enhance the classification performance, a neural network architecture has been designed. This may include layers such as Embedding layers, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, and Dense layers. The neural network aims to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within the text data that might be challenging for traditional models.

Training and Fine-tuning:
The neural network is trained on the preprocessed SMS dataset, with a focus on optimizing hyperparameters and avoiding overfitting. Techniques such as dropout and batch normalization may be applied to improve generalization.

Evaluation Metrics:
The project evaluates the performance of the SVM model and the neural network using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comprehensive evaluation helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

Streamlit Deployment:
The project is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input text messages and receive real-time predictions on whether they are spam or not. The deployment process ensures accessibility and practical usability of the developed models.

Conclusion:
Through this project, the aim is to showcase the effectiveness of combining traditional machine learning models, such as SVM, with advanced neural network architectures in the domain of SMS spam classification. The 98% accuracy achieved by the SVM model serves as a benchmark, and the neural network model is expected to demonstrate improved performance, providing valuable insights into the evolving field of NLP and machine learning.
